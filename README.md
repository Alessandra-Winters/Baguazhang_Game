# Baguazhang_Game
Individual Game for Gimm Degree
I have a bubling cauldron noise which (right now is attatched to a large blue cube) and is 3D looping
I have a "bell" (guitar chord) sound which is triggered by player proximity
I have a 2D ambient sound for the game to give it some "white noise". (less true slience = better immersion)
